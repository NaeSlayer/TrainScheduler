# TrainScheduler

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.

To use this app, just enter Train Name, 
Destination, First Train time (00:00-military time), and Frequency (min), then hit "Submit"!
